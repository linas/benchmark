# Benchmark

Collection of tools and data to benchmark the AtomSpace, the pattern
matcher and other OpenCog processes.

## Organization
Each distinct benchmark has it's own instructions for building and
running it.  See individual directories for details.

The most interesting benchmarks are probably the **query-links** and
**query-loop** benchmarks (because they are "real-world" benchmarks)
and the **atomspace** benchmark (because it has a very long measurement
history, despite being deeply flawed).

* __assembly__ -- examination of assembly code of some simple programs.

* __atomspace__ -- A synthetic benchmark for measuring core AtomSpace
  functions, such as rates for creating `Node`s and `Link`s, rates for
  deleting them, and rates for setting and getting `TruthValue`s and
  `IncomingSet`s.

* __micro__ -- Micro-benchmarks for misc items. ***These benchmarks
  do not work correctly! They're just plain broken! They report
  incorrect results! DO NOT USE!***  See the README in the subdirectory
  for details about what's wrong.

* __python__ -- Benchmarks for the python bindings to various AtomSpace
  subsystems.

* __query-trite__ -- A synthetic benchmark containing some trivial
  pattern matcher queries.

* __query-links__ -- Several real-world benchmarks for performing
  complex pattern matches on a real-world natural-language dataset.
  One models an activity one might need in a parser, that of joining
  together connectors. It creates 576 `BindLink`'s with four `GlobNodes`
  and a `Variable`, each.  The `Glob`s are used to search for connectable
  connectors, similar to what parser would need to do.  That is, this
  is a search over "jigsaw puzzle pieces", looking for pairs of jigsaw
  pieces that can connect.

  A second benchmark in this directory computes dot products of vectors
  in six different ways, each using an increasingly complex query
  pattern. Uses the same base dataset.

* __query-loop__ -- A real-world benchmark for performing a complex
  pattern match on a real-world genome dataset. Uses EvaluationLink
  in a simple/straight-forward way to represent the edges and vertices
  of a large graph (for gene/protein interactions), and then hunts
  for triangles and pentagons in that graph.

* __cogserver__ -- Benchmark of network I/O to the cogserver.
  Highlights issues created by using `netcat` instead of using native
  socket I/O.

## Using perf
It can be useful to use `perf`. Sometimes. Maybe. Here's the
cheat-sheet:

To record 15 seconds worth:
```
sudo perf record -F 199 -p pid --call-graph fp -- sleep 15
```
CAUTION: need to run perf as root, and it writes crap into the
/root/.debug folder!  This eats disk!

```
perf report
perf report -n
perf report --stdio -n -g -G
```
